This is a document to roughly describe the though process throughout the build.

1. Decided to use a starter as its a technology I'm not familiar with and would likely be quicker to build out from a starter kit compared to scratch.
Went with the peak pack as it had seemingly more options for building out pages as well as SEO features built in; its easier to start with those features there and not used than trying to add later on
2. Next was to create the main pages as per the design brief
3. Then I built out the films collection and entities as they are the main content for the site
